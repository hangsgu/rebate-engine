# Exercise : Rebate Engine Feature Development 

## Learning Goal
- Get familiar with the provided code base and understand how to run WebShop application in your local environment. 
- To practice Test Driven Development and pair programming.

## Webshop and Rebate Engine Background
WebShop is a  legacy system which has large number of manual integration tests and very few unit tests.
Even the manual tests concerning the home component(WebShop) requires elaborate system setup with the external dependencies and requires considerable effort and time. 
Developers do not dare to make changes to the existing system due to the fear of regressions.

## Exercise Flow:
* Bring up WebShop Application(Legacy Application) on your local environment.
* Implement Rebate Engine functionality in Test Driven Development(TDD).
* Enhance the Web Shop with the Rebate Engine.
* Run the integration tests to showcase how regressions have been caught and how the integration  tests act as a safety net.
